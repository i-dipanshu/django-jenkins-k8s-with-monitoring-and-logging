# Simulating a Production-Grade Infrastructure Locally

In DevOps and infrastructure management, understanding production-grade setups is crucial. However, transitioning theory into practice can be challenging. This project offers a practical simulation to help both newcomers and professionals explore the complexities of production-level infrastructure, all within the comfort of your computer.

**Note:** It's important to keep in mind that this project offers a high-level overview of a production-level infrastructure, providing foundational knowledge only. In reality, production infrastructures are often much more complex and larger.

## **The Purpose**

The primary aim of this project is to provide an practical learning experience, helping you gain valuable insights into the complexities of designing, creating and managing production-grade infrastructure. By actively engaging with this project, you'll develop a deep understanding of the essential prerequisites for deploying and maintaining enterprise-level infrastructure.

## **The Challenge**

Imagine you have an application that needs to operate at an enterprise level, and you want to understand the complexities of such an environment. This project guides you through setting up a production-grade infrastructure on your local machine.

## **The Solution**

This project offers a step-by-step guide to explore and understand the complexities of production-grade infrastructure locally by doing. It takes an application and transforms it into a robust deployment within a Kubernetes environment, automates application updates using Jenkins and Argo CD, provides user-friendly monitoring dashboards with Prometheus and Grafana, and offers log management and analysis with the EFK stack.

## **Project Description**

This project lets you simulate a high-level production-grade infrastructure on your local. This includes:

1. **Deployment of a Django CRUD Application**: Set up a Django CRUD application within a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster
2. **Argo CD for Continuous Deployment**: Use Argo CD to automate continuous deployment
3. **Continuous Integration with Jenkins**: Implement Continuous Integration (CI) using a Jenkins
4. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**: Set up robust monitoring capabilities using Prometheus and visualize the data with Grafana.
5. **Managing and analyzing Logs using EFK Stack**: Implement the EFK stack to centralize and manage logging

## The Implementation

For a more in-depth description of this project, please refer to the [Project Documentation](./docs/README.md).

### The Flow of Docs
Each stage has two types of documentation. One provides information about the tool or technologies, explaining why they are needed, and the other is a guide to implement it.

### The Flow of the Project

I have divided this project into 5 stages. We'll delve into one stage at a time.
