# Logging in Kubernetes cluster using EFK Stack

The EFK Stack is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing logs in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. EFK stands for Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana, with each component playing a crucial role in log management and visualization.

### What is EFK Stack ?

1. **Elasticsearch (E):** Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine. In the EFK Stack, Elasticsearch serves as the storage and search backend for log data. It allows you to store, search, and analyze large volumes of log data efficiently.

2. **Fluentd (F):** Fluentd is a log collector and shipper. It gathers log data from various sources within your K8s cluster and forwards it to Elasticsearch for indexing. Fluentd ensures that log data is efficiently transported to the central log storage.

3. **Kibana (K):** Kibana is a web-based user interface for visualizing and exploring log data. It provides powerful tools for creating custom dashboards, searching and filtering logs, and gaining insights from your log data.

## Why Do We Need EFK Stack?

The EFK Stack is essential for several reasons:

- **Centralized Log Management:** EFK allows you to centralize log data from multiple Kubernetes pods and nodes, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot your applications.

- **Efficient Search and Analysis:** Elasticsearch's search capabilities and Kibana's intuitive interface enable efficient log data search and analysis, helping you detect and resolve issues quickly.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** With Fluentd's log shipping capabilities, you can achieve real-time log monitoring, ensuring that you stay informed about your cluster's activities.

## Implementation in K8s Cluster

In this section, we will guide you through the process of implementing the EFK Stack in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Set Up the EFK Stack in Our Cluster**

Follow the detailed instructions in the [01-Setup-EFK-Stack](./01-Setup-EFK-Stack) guide to set up the EFK Stack components, including Elasticsearch as a StatefulSet, Fluentd as a DaemonSet, and Kibana as a Deployment.

**Step 2: Explore the Kibana UI**

After successfully setting up the EFK Stack, you can explore the Kibana user interface by following the steps outlined in [02-Explore-Kibana-UI.md](./02-Explore-Kibana-UI.md). This guide will help you get started with visualizing and analyzing your log data using Kibana.
