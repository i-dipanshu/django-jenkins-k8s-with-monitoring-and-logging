# Configuring ArgoCD using Operators in a Kubernetes Cluster

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster:** Ensure you have a functioning Kubernetes cluster.

2. **kubectl:** Make sure you have `kubectl` installed and configured to access your cluster.

3. **Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):** We'll need OLM to install the ArgoCD Operator. You can install it by running the following command:

   ```sh
   curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.25.0/install.sh | bash -s v0.25.0
   ```

## Install the ArgoCD Operator
To install the ArgoCD Operator, follow these simple steps:

1. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/argocd-operator.yaml
   ```

2. The ArgoCD Operator will be installed in the "operators" namespace and will be available for use in all namespaces within your cluster.

3. You can check the installation progress by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get csv -n operators
   ```

## Deploy the ArgoCD Controller

Now, let's deploy the ArgoCD Controller as a pod in your cluster:

1. Create a file named `argo-cd.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ArgoCD
   metadata:
     name: example-argocd
     labels:
       example: basic
   spec: {}
   ```

2. Apply the configuration using this command:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f argo-cd.yml
   ```

3. After the deployment is successful, check the pods and services created for the ArgoCD Controller:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -A
   kubectl get svc -A
   ```

## Accessing the ArgoCD Controller UI

### Change the service type to NodePort
```sh
kubectl edit svc example-argocd-server
```
Run the above command, and look for `type: ClusterIP` and change it type: `NodePort`

### Generate a URL for accessing the UI
```sh
minikube service example-argocd-server
```
Copy the url and paste in the web browser to access the argocd UI. 


## Obtaining ID and Password

To get the login credentials for ArgoCD, follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the secrets for the ArgoCD cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl get secrets example-argocd-cluster -o yaml
   ```

2. Locate the `admin.password` field in the data block of the output. This is your encoded password.

3. Decode the password using the following command:

   ```sh
   echo <copied-password-here> | base64 -d
   ```

4. Copy the generated output, excluding any trailing character ie; (%). This is your ArgoCD password for `admin user`. Use `admin` in the id field and click on signin.

With these steps completed, you should now have access to the ArgoCD Controller UI.
