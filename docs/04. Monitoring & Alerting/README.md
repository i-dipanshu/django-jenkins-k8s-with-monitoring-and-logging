# Monitoring Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus and Grafana

In the world of Kubernetes (k8s), monitoring is crucial to ensure the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure. Two powerful tools for achieving this are Prometheus and Grafana.

### What is Prometheus?

**Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It's designed for reliability and scalability, making it an excellent choice for monitoring your Kubernetes clusters. 

To know more about Prometheus refer official [documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).

### What is Grafana?

**Grafana** is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides a flexible and customizable dashboard, which is essential for visualizing Prometheus data effectively.

To know more about Grafana refer official [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/)

## Why Do You Need Monitoring and Alerting in Kubernetes?

Before we dive into the implementation, let's understand why monitoring and alerting are essential in a Kubernetes environment.

Kubernetes is dynamic and can change rapidly as containers are deployed, scaled, and terminated. Without proper monitoring, it's challenging to:

- Detect issues and anomalies in your cluster.
- Ensure the availability and performance of your applications.
- Troubleshoot problems quickly.
- Plan for scaling and resource optimization.

## Implementation

Now, let's get into the practical steps of implementing Prometheus and Grafana for Kubernetes monitoring.

### Step 1: Installing Prometheus and Grafana in Your Cluster

In this step, you will learn how to install Prometheus and Grafana into your Kubernetes cluster. Refer to the detailed guide in the [01. Install-Prometheus-Grafana.md](./01.%20Install-Prometheus-Grafana.md) file for step-by-step instructions.

### Step 2: Setting Up Grafana Dashboards

Once Prometheus and Grafana are up and running, it's time to set up customized dashboards to visualize your Kubernetes metrics effectively. Find the detailed guide in the [02. Setup-Grafana-Dashboards.md](./02-Setup-Grafana-Dashboards.md) file.

### Step 3: Setting Up Alerts

Monitoring without alerts is incomplete. In this step, you will learn how to configure alerts in Prometheus to proactively detect and respond to issues in your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the guide in the [03. Setup-Alerts.md](./03-Setup-Alerts.md) file.

By following these steps, you'll have a robust Kubernetes monitoring and alerting system in place, ensuring the reliability and performance of your applications running in Kubernetes.
