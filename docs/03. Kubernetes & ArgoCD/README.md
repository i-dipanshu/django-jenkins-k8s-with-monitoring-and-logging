## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and scalable framework for managing containers, making it easier to deploy and manage applications in a cloud-native environment.

## Why Kubernetes?

1. **Scalability:** Kubernetes allows to scale applications up or down effortlessly, accommodating changing workloads.

2. **Portability:** Kubernetes can run on various cloud providers or on-premises infrastructure, providing flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

3. **Automation:** It automates many tasks involved in managing containers, reducing manual intervention and operational overhead.

## Why ArgoCD ?

ArgoCD is a declarative, continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It defines application configurations in Git repositories and automatically synchronize them with  Kubernetes clusters.

1. **Declarative Configuration:** ArgoCD ensures that  applications are configured declaratively, which means  specify the desired state, and ArgoCD takes care of making it a reality.

2. **Version Control:** By using Git repositories to store configurations,  gain version control, auditability, and collaboration benefits.

3. **Automated Sync:** ArgoCD continuously monitors  Git repositories and automatically syncs changes to  Kubernetes clusters, ensuring consistency.

4. **Rollback and History:**  can easily roll back to previous versions of  application configurations, providing a safety net in case of issues.

## What is Kubernetes Operator and Kubernetes Controller?

In Kubernetes, both Operators and Controllers are essential components for managing applications and resources.

### Kubernetes Controller:
A Kubernetes Controller is a built-in control loop that observes the desired state of a resource and takes action to make the current state match the desired state. Controllers are a fundamental part of Kubernetes and manage resources like Pods, Services, and Deployments.

### Kubernetes Operator:
A Kubernetes Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications. Operators use custom resources to define and manage application-specific logic.

## Why Use Kubernetes Operator to Manage ArgoCD Controller?

Using Kubernetes Operators to manage ArgoCD Controller offers several advantages:

- **Automation:** Operators automate the deployment and management of ArgoCD Controller, reducing manual intervention.

- **Custom Logic:** Operators allow  to define custom logic for managing ArgoCD, adapting it to  specific requirements.

- **Lifecycle Management:** OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager) simplifies the installation and management of Operators, ensuring they are always up to date.

- **Self-Healing:** Operators can detect and recover from failures, ensuring the reliability of ArgoCD.

For more details on Operators,  can refer to [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/how-to-install-an-operator#What-happens-when-I-execute-the-'Install'-command-presented-in-the-pop-up?).

# How ArgoCD works in our application ??

1. **Configuration Setup**: First, ArgoCD needs to be properly configured to work with our project. This includes specifying the target Kubernetes cluster and the manifest repository where our application configurations are stored.

2. **Polling for Changes**: Once configured, ArgoCD continuously monitors the designated manifest repository for any changes. It regularly checks for updates, ensuring that our Kubernetes resources stay synchronized with the desired state.

3. **Integration with Jenkins**: ArgoCD seamlessly integrates with our Jenkins CI pipeline. Whenever Jenkins makes changes to the CI, such as updating the image tag, ArgoCD detects these modifications.

4. **Deployment Updates**: When Jenkins updates the image tag, ArgoCD springs into action. It fetches the new image from DockerHub, ensuring that our application stays current. ArgoCD then automatically updates the deployment object in our Kubernetes cluster, implementing the changes without manual intervention.

# Implementation

This section will walk you through the process of setting up and deploying applications using Kubernetes (K8s) and configure CD using ArgoCD. Follow these steps: 

**Step 1: Configure the Kubernetes Cluster**

Before you begin deploying applications, you need to set up your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the instructions in the [Configuring Kubernetes Cluster](./01.%20Configuring-k8s-cluster.md) to get your cluster up and running.

**Step 2: Configure ArgoCD**

Refer to the [Configuring ArgoCD](./02.%20Configuring-argocd.md) for detailed instructions on setting up ArgoCD.

**Step 3: Deploy Your Application with ArgoCD**

Now that your cluster and ArgoCD are configured, it's time to deploy your application. Follow the steps outlined in the [Deploying Applications using ArgoCD](./03.%20Deploy-app-using-argocd.md) to deploy your app effortlessly.
