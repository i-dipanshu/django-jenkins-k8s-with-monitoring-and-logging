# Configuring Kubernetes Cluster using Minikube

## Introduction

This section documentation will guide you through the process of configuring a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally on your machine for development and testing purposes.

For more detailed information about Minikube, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Minikube on your Ubuntu machine:

1. Download the latest Minikube release using the following command:

   ```sh
   curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube_latest_amd64.deb
   ```

2. Install Minikube using the following command:

   ```sh
   sudo dpkg -i minikube_latest_amd64.deb
   ```

If you are using a different operating system, please refer to the Minikube [documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for installation instructions tailored to your environment.

## Starting the Kubernetes Cluster

Once Minikube is installed, you can start your Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```sh
minikube start
```

This command initializes and starts a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
